## Introduction
In this article, we will explore the concept of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Hyd
ration in Next.js. SSR is a powerful feature that allows you to render pages on the server, providing a fully rendered HTML page to the client. This can significantly improve performance and SEO for your web applications.

## What is SSR with Hydration?
SSR with Hydration is a rendering strategy in Next.js where the server generates the initial HTML for
a page, and then the client "hydrates" that HTML with JavaScript to make it interactive. This means that the server sends a fully rendered page to the browser, which can display content immediately, while also preparing the page for client-side interactivity.

## Benefits of SSR with Hydration
- **Improved Performance**: Since the server sends a fully rendered page, users can see
  content faster, especially on slower networks or devices.
- **Better SEO**: Search engines can index the fully rendered HTML, improving visibility in search
  results.
- **Reduced Time to Interactive**: The initial load time is reduced, as the browser can display content before the JavaScript is fully loaded and executed.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can start interacting with the page sooner, leading to a smoother experience.

## How SSR with Hydration Works in Next.js
Next.js handles SSR with Hydration automatically. When you create a page using Next.js, it
can be rendered on the server by default. Here's a simple example of how to implement SSR with
Hydration in a Next.js page:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
export default function SSRPage() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch data on the client side after hydration
    fetch('/api/data')
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>SSR with Hydration Example</h1>
      {data ? <p>Data: {data}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
