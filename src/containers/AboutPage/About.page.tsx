            Hi there! I&rsquo;m Albert, a Software Engineer working with
            JavaScript in web ecosystem.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-5 text-lg text-primary-100 dark:text-txt-100">
            In early 2019, I had my first experience learning web development,
            where I took a course on web programming fundamental taught by
            Dicoding Indonesia. It was fun and challenging to learn new things
            that weren&rsquo;t quite aligned with my major (fun fact: I&rsquo;m
            not a computer science or IT student). I really enjoyed my time and
            learned a lot about HTML, CSS and programming with JavaScript. Since
            then, I have been continued my learning journey through online
            courses, YouTube videos, articles and have explored more about web
            development, especially front-end development.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5 text-lg text-primary-100 dark:text-txt-100">
            Currently, I am working as a{" "}
            <span className="text-subAccent">Frontend Engineer</span> at an IT
            consulting company in Indonesia. This is my first Full-time
            experience working on client-based consulting, where I build
            web-based internal tools for Enterprise. My work involves from
            creating and maintaining reusable components, redefining folder
            structures, conducting code reviews, and fixing bugs. Besides that,
            I also{" "}
            <span className="text-subAccent">
              Lead the frontend development team
            </span>{" "}
            on project, where my contributions include managing and prioritizing
            tasks, defining requirements for future development, handling
            deployment and work closely with the manager and stakeholders. Wow,
            this is my first experience leading a team! I still have a lot to
            learn in order to become a better leader in the future.
