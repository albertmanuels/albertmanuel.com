          Hi there! I&rsquo;m Albert, a Software Engineer working with
          JavaScript in web ecosystem.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-5 text-lg text-primary-100 dark:text-txt-100">
          In early 2019, I had my first experience learning web development,
          where I took a course on web programming fundamental taught by
          Dicoding Indonesia. It was fun and challenging to learn new things
          that weren&rsquo;t quite aligned with my major (fun fact: I&rsquo;m
          not a computer science or IT student). I really enjoyed my time and
          learned a lot about HTML, CSS and programming with JavaScript. Since
          then, I have been continued my learning journey through online
          courses, YouTube videos, articles and have explored more about web
          development, especially front-end development.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5 text-lg text-primary-100 dark:text-txt-100">
          Currently, I am working as a{" "}
          <span class="text-subAccent">Frontend Engineer</span> at an IT consulting
          company in Indonesia. This is my first Full-time experience working on
          client-based consulting, where I build web-based internal tools for Enterprise.
          My work involves from creating and maintaining reusable components, redefining
          folder structures, conducting code reviews, and fixing bugs. Besides that,
          I also{" "}
          <span class="text-subAccent">
            Lead the frontend development team
          </span>{" "}
          on project, where my contributions include managing and prioritizing tasks,
          defining requirements for future development, handling deployment and work
          closely with the manager and stakeholders. Wow, this is my first experience
          leading a team! I still have a lot to learn in order to become a better
          leader in the future.

          On this website, I&rsquo;ve started writing blog articles as part of
